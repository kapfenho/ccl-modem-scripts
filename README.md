## Modem Scripts for Mac

*Communication Command Language*

Some additional drivers for UMTS modems as USB device (like ZTE).

Those scripts _might work_ for you if

* you are using MAC OS X
* you've got one of the supported UMTS USB adapters
* you are located in Austria


### Deployment

The included `bin/deploy.sh` script in copies all modem scripts to your
system's `/Library/Modem\ Scripts` folder.

Now you can select the new modem in the list of available modems.
